MASSIVE thanks to janik. He inspired this, and I also used some of his code. He is the man:
github.com/JanikThePanic

Janik, if you are reading this, thank you.

I do a lot of the same projects that he does, because he does them really well and I want to push myself to do the same.

I try to stay on the side of being inspired and not copying, but this one might be a little copied. Either way, I learned a lot about web dev and JS.

:)
